HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
The <form> Element
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input:

<form>
.
form elements
.
</form>
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

All the different form elements are covered in this chapter: HTML Form Elements.

The <input> Element
The HTML <input> element is the most used form element.

An <input> element can be displayed in many ways, depending on the type attribute.

Here are some examples:

Type	Description
<input type="text">	Displays a single-line text input field
<input type="radio">	Displays a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type="checkbox">	Displays a checkbox (for selecting zero or more of many choices)
<input type="submit">	Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)
<input type="button">	Displays a clickable button
All the different input types are covered in this chapter: HTML Input Types.

Text Fields
The <input type="text"> defines a single-line input field for text input.

Example
A form with input fields for text:

<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname">
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:

First name:

Last name:
Note: The form itself is not visible. Also note that the default width of an input field is 20 characters.

The <label> Element
Notice the use of the <label> element in the example above.

The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.

The <label> element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.

Radio Buttons
The <input type="radio"> defines a radio button.
Radio buttons let a user select ONE of a limited number of choices.
Example
A form with radio buttons:
<p>Choose your favorite Web language:</p>
<form>
  <input type="radio" id="html" name="fav_language" value="HTML">
  <label for="html">HTML</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="css" name="fav_language" value="CSS">
  <label for="css">CSS</label><br>
  <input type="radio" id="javascript" name="fav_language" value="JavaScript">
  <label for="javascript">JavaScript</label>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser
Checkboxes
The <input type="checkbox"> defines a checkbox.
Checkboxes let a user select ZERO or MORE options of a limited number of choices.
Example
A form with checkboxes
<form>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1" name="vehicle1" value="Bike">
  <label for="vehicle1"> I have a bike</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle2" name="vehicle2" value="Car">
  <label for="vehicle2"> I have a car</label><br>
  <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle3" name="vehicle3" value="Boat">
  <label for="vehicle3"> I have a boat</label>
</form>
This is how the HTML code above will be displayed in a browser:
 I have a bike
 I have a car
 I have a boat
The Submit Button
The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.
The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.
The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.
