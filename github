GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.
GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.
You can use the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code to generate code, or to learn from the code it generates.
Features:
Connect - From the Team Explorer section, click the Connect... button in the GitHub invitation section to login to the extension. The extension supports two-factor authentication (2fa) with GitHub and stores credentials in the Windows Credential store so that Git Operations within Visual Studio work with your GitHub repositories. The extension also supports logging into a GitHub Enterprise instance.
Clone - Once connected, click on the Clone button to list all repositories that you have access to on GitHub.
Create - The create dialog lets you create a repository on GitHub.com and locally that are connected together.
Publish - For a local-only repository, click on the Sync navigation item to get the GitHub publish control. This make it quick to publish your local work up to GitHub.

Create Gist - Create gists by using the GitHub context menu when you right-click on selected text
